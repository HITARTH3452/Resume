    <h3>Hospital Appointment</h3><a href="https://github.com/HITARTH3452/Doctor_App.git">[Github Link]</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a Spring Boot MVC application for a doctor appointment system, enabling doctors and patients to
            perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through APIs, ensuring a streamlined appointment
            process</li>
        <li>Utilised a tech stack comprising Spring Boot, Postman, Swagger, Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
            principles, AWS, and Hibernate. This combination of technologies facilitated efficient development, testing,
            and deployment of the application.</li>
        <li>Integrated the application with a MySQL database to store and retrieve appointment-related data, and
            utilised Postman for API testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of the developed APIs.
            Additionally, deployed the application on AWS, making it accessible and scalable for potential users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instagram basic</h3><a href="https://github.com/HITARTH3452/Instagram_WT.git">[Github Link]</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed an Instagram basic model, implementing key features such as follow, following, comment, and like
            functionalities. Incorporated CRUD operations, validation, and authentication to ensure data integrity and
            user security.</li>
        <li>Configured a MySQL database and established table relationships to store and manage the application's data
            effectively. Leveraged the Spring Boot framework and Hibernate ORM to streamline database operations and
            enhance performance.</li>
        <li>Connected the application to MySQL database and utilised Postman for API testing to verify the functionality
            and reliability of the implemented features. Documented the APIs using Swagger for easy reference and
            integration. Furthermore, deployed the application on AWS.</li>
